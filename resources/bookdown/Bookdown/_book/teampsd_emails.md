## Team PSD Emails 

- [ ] 1.	Assume everyone you’re communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you.

- [ ] 2.	Be sure to include all the facts needed so the recipient can reply without having to ask you questions first.

- [ ] 3.	Use emojis provided it’s not a formal context — they’re basically a digital stand-in for facial expression. All the tools that we do have to make sure that we’re not misunderstood, we should use.

- [ ] 4.	Use your subject line to tell the recipient what your email is going to say.

- [ ] 5.	Email during business hours. Schedule if necessary. East Coast end of tour is our 1:30PM.
