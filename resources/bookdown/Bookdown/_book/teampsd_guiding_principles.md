# TeamPSD Guiding Principles		

### 1. We value an open-source, transparent & reproducible workflow.
- Most of our work is public-facing with the exception of any items that include Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All of our public materials are free to download and use. We want our insights and resources to benefit the larger community. 
- We use R, a free open-source coding language and a specific file naming convention to ensure all of our matierals are machine & human readable (all lower case, no spaces, with dates as yyyy_mm_dd i.e. teampsd_guiding_principles_2020_01_01).
- Use email for any private discussions. Host any private files in password-protected locations or in folders behind the VA firewall. When in doubt, ask an HQ member or err on the side of caution.
- Make sure your work and accompanying documentation allows other team members or scientists in the field to reproduce and understand your work without further questions.

### 2. Our work has high visibility.
- Keep in mind we work under the federal government of the United States for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the country. Everything we produce is a reflection of the VHA.
- We work with a wide range of nationally-distributed partners both internal and external to VA, including very important and high-level stakeholders. Double check the role and responsibility of people you are communicating with before you do.
- With these partners, we work in a participatory learning manner and iterate based on feedback from the field to ensure our work is responsive to ongoing changes.

### 3. Any time saved is team time.
- Ask questions early and often to prevent escalating issues down the road. Refer to existing resources (cheatsheets, checklists, etc.) as well for clarification.
- Double check all work before handing it off to the next team member to reduce rework.
- Think through dependencies across the team and partners and prioritize work based on the most recent information you have.
- Manage workflow asynchronously (via GitHub) and only schedule meetings when absolutely necessary.

### 4. Use effective communication (across all types of communication including emails, GitHub, Lucid, etc.).  		
- Assume everyone youâ€™re communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you. 
- Use clear and concise language, with formatting (bold, underline, bullets, etc) to emphasize the main decisions or issues making sure to include the "Who" "What" and "When".
- Always include the full context and details necessary to make an informed decision (and make sure you are up to speed on the context and details before responding). 
- Use complete sentences as much as possible and write in the active voice for clarity
- Often the team looks back to previous records of meetings, GitHub discussions, etc. to remember and track decisions that were already made or if they missed the meetings where an issue may have been discussed. As such, we always need to keep the most accurate record possible to reduce rework and provide clarity.
- Use emojis or humor (as appropriate) to help maintain a positive and collegial vibe. Turn on your webcam as much as possible for the face-to-face interaction.

### 5. Use active listening skills to ensure understanding and accurate tracking.	
- We work daily with team members and partners that are experts in their respective fields, and it is easy to lose track of a complex discussion.
- We've found that reflecting-back requests and decisions in your own words has been the best method to reduce miscommunication and to keep track of all of our decisions or issues accurately. If you ever need help while scribing, always "tap" someone else on the team for assistance.
- Ask for clarification and slow down if necessary.
