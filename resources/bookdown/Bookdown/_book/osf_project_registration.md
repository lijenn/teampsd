## Instructions

### Prior to registering a project:
-	Know what type of registration form you need? Where are you now with your project?
    - [(1) Understanding Registration Forms](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738794-Understand-Registration-Forms), you can also click on the (i) icon during registration process for the same information found here
-	Are you waiting for something on your project? Embargo or publicize immediately? 
    -	OSF can leave the registration in embargo for up to 4 years
    -	Embargo keeps a registration private until a specified date. When you enter your registration into an embargo, you can end the embargo early to make your registration public sooner.
    -	Registration can make project immediately public 
        - Pushing the registration to public will not allow any further changes or document uploads besides metadata (Description, Category, Publication, DOI, Affiliated Institutions License, and Tags)
- Registrations cannot be deleted and are irreversible
-	Withdrawing a registration will leave the metadata (title, contributors, DOI, etc) 
-	All submitted registrations will be in a "pending" state until all admins approve the registration (email sent with links) or 48 hours pass (whichever comes first)
-	OSF’s auto-save feature does not always work (See ['Edit a Draft Registration'](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/osf_project_registration_jl_01_28_2020/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_osf/osf_project_registration.md#edit-a-draft-registration-httpshelposfiohcen-usarticles360019930933-edit-a-draft-registration))

## Creating a Registration
### [(2) Register Your Project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930893-Register-Your-Project)
-	Must know what type of [(1) Registration Form](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738794-Understand-Registration-Forms) you need prior to starting
-	Most common registration type is: OSF Preregistration and Open-Ended Registration
-	Follow Steps 1-7 in [(2) Register Your Project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930893-Register-Your-Project). Step 7 will send an email to the admins to accept or cancel the registration. 

### [(3) Create a Preregistration](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738834-Create-a-Preregistration)
-	Only do this if you have your entire research plan (design, sampling, variables, analysis, other,)
-	**NOTE**: If you plan to submit your preregistration for blinded peer-review, check to make sure that no identifying information is included in your data plan when you submit your preregistration. After submission, you can create a view-only link and anonymize your name on the "Registration Overview" page and the "Authors" section of the form; however, if your name is included in an attachment on the form, the view-only link will not work to hide this. Once you submit a preregistration, you will not be able to edit or make changes to it.

### [(4) Submit a Registered Report](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930913-Submit-a-Registered-Report)
-	In order to be eligible for this form, you need to first have received "in principle acceptance" (IPA) from a journal **after** Stage 1 Peer Review, and **before** you have begun your study.

### [(5) Edit a Draft Registration](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930933-Edit-a-Draft-Registration)
-	Despite the OSF guide saying that draft forms are auto-saved, be sure to check when the draft was last auto saved
    - Even if it says ‘a few seconds ago’, it will **not ALWAYS** mean that it will save the edits/changes you made
    - Instead, click on ‘Review’ to review the edits you made, then ‘<-- Back’ before exiting out of your draft
