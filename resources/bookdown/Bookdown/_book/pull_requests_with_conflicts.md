# Pull Requests with Conflicts

In this example, I manually resolved conflicts in two files *by accepting all the text in order to avoid any possible deletion of work across the team*.

**THE TWO FILES:**
**1. mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/day2/session3_mutual learning_activity.rmd**
**2. mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/day2/session6_in_session_activity.rmd**

*NOTE: I decided to keep all text to avoid loss of work.*

**1. I could see I was 26 commits ahead, and 42 commits behind master on my lzim branch:**

2. I selected **compare and pull request**, to start the pull request and noted the changes I made on my branch.

3. I received this notification that my branch had conflicts to resolve. I clicked the **blue link** to use the **web editer** to resolve conflicts.

4. The web editor showed me two conflicts in one file, and one conflict in the other **See the files listed on the left, and the red 'conflicts' text on the right. I can toggle to view the text itself**

5. Googling for help on this showed me that **I should manually edit to the text I want between the two files.** When I **delete the lines <<<<<<< master** GitHub knows it has been reviewed. And, then I can **click the button on the upper right 'resolve conflicts'**

6. The differences are accepted by  by deleting the **<<<<<<< master** text. And I see the **green check mark on the left** and and so I select the **green 'commit merge'** button.
