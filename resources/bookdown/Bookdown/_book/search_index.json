["teampsd-guiding-principles.html", "Chapter 2 TeamPSD Guiding Principles", " Chapter 2 TeamPSD Guiding Principles 2.0.1 1. We value an open-source, transparent &amp; reproducible workflow. Most of our work is public-facing with the exception of any items that include Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All of our public materials are free to download and use. We want our insights and resources to benefit the larger community. We use R, a free open-source coding language and a specific file naming convention to ensure all of our matierals are machine &amp; human readable (all lower case, no spaces, with dates as yyyy_mm_dd i.e. teampsd_guiding_principles_2020_01_01). Use email for any private discussions. Host any private files in password-protected locations or in folders behind the VA firewall. When in doubt, ask an HQ member or err on the side of caution. Make sure your work and accompanying documentation allows other team members or scientists in the field to reproduce and understand your work without further questions. 2.0.2 2. Our work has high visibility. Keep in mind we work under the federal government of the United States for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the country. Everything we produce is a reflection of the VHA. We work with a wide range of nationally-distributed partners both internal and external to VA, including very important and high-level stakeholders. Double check the role and responsibility of people you are communicating with before you do. With these partners, we work in a participatory learning manner and iterate based on feedback from the field to ensure our work is responsive to ongoing changes. 2.0.3 3. Any time saved is team time. Ask questions early and often to prevent escalating issues down the road. Refer to existing resources (cheatsheets, checklists, etc.) as well for clarification. Double check all work before handing it off to the next team member to reduce rework. Think through dependencies across the team and partners and prioritize work based on the most recent information you have. Manage workflow asynchronously (via GitHub) and only schedule meetings when absolutely necessary. 2.0.4 4. Use effective communication (across all types of communication including emails, GitHub, Lucid, etc.). Assume everyone you’re communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you. Use clear and concise language, with formatting (bold, underline, bullets, etc) to emphasize the main decisions or issues making sure to include the “Who” “What” and “When”. Always include the full context and details necessary to make an informed decision (and make sure you are up to speed on the context and details before responding). Use complete sentences as much as possible and write in the active voice for clarity Often the team looks back to previous records of meetings, GitHub discussions, etc. to remember and track decisions that were already made or if they missed the meetings where an issue may have been discussed. As such, we always need to keep the most accurate record possible to reduce rework and provide clarity. Use emojis or humor (as appropriate) to help maintain a positive and collegial vibe. Turn on your webcam as much as possible for the face-to-face interaction. 2.0.5 5. Use active listening skills to ensure understanding and accurate tracking. We work daily with team members and partners that are experts in their respective fields, and it is easy to lose track of a complex discussion. We’ve found that reflecting-back requests and decisions in your own words has been the best method to reduce miscommunication and to keep track of all of our decisions or issues accurately. If you ever need help while scribing, always “tap” someone else on the team for assistance. Ask for clarification and slow down if necessary. "],

Be sure to include all the facts needed so the recipient can reply without having to ask you questions first. 3. Use emojis provided it’s not a formal context — they’re basically a digital stand-in for facial expression. All the tools that we do have to make sure that we’re not misunderstood, we should use. 4.

It will teach you about repositories, branches, commits, and opening/merging pull requests. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 4.0.2 Style We use R Markdown format for syntax and style which you can refer to here (ADD HYPERLINK). Use a human and computer readable format to name files, meaning all lowercase, underscores, and dates (as necesary) with a name that will be meaningful to whoever reads it. For other style guidelines on TeamPSD materials, please refer to (HYPERLINK) 4.0.3 Creating and Editing Files To create files, choose the branch or folder you want and click “Create New File.” To view the file’s code, simply click “Raw” in the top right corner of the file, next to “Blame” and “History.” To view comments that you/others have added, you can click on “History” and then check for an “ellipses” symbol. This symbol indicates that a comment has been added to the commit. To see the comment, click on the ellipses. 4.0.4 Uploading Files To upload files, choose the branch or folder you want and upload the file. The file will be named as it was in your computer, so make sure to give the file a name according that is simple and reflective of its contents to anyone that reads the file name. 4.0.5 Downloading Files Files cannot be downloaded individually - you have to download the entire branch. You can find the green “Download” button on the main page of each branch. 4.0.6 Creating and Editing Branches Open up the specific file you want to edit. Create a new working branch and name it using all lowercase, no spaces (use underscores), and your initials - i.e. “facilitation_guide_sp”. Make sure you’re in the branch you just created instead of the original branch. Click the pencil icon to edit. Edit the file and add comments on changes you made. Click on “Commit”. 4.0.7 Creating and Editing Pull Requests Go to “Pull Requests” and click on “New Pull Request”. The “Base” branch should be the original branch (most likely “master”). The “Compare” branch will be the branch you created. Click on “Create a New Pull Request”. Add “Reviewers” and click on “TeamPSD” for the “Project section. Click on”Create Pull Request\".

["full-instructions-1.html", "5.4 Full Instructions", " 5.4 Full Instructions TeamPSD has 3 types of templates for cards The templates for these can all be found in the TeamPSD repository under: - For Issues &amp; Features: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE - For Manuscripts &amp; Documents: issue_templates Issues &amp; Features This template is the default template when you go to “create a new issue” in here. You can also navigate to this page by going to the Issues button at the top next to “Code”. Click on “New Issue”, then “Get Started”. We use this pre-populated template only for items that are “issues” (products or functions that already exist but are broken) and “features” (products or functions that do not already exist and need to be scoped out). Make sure to add: - Projects - Unless you create an issue specifically for the document or manuscript trackers, always assign the issue to “issue_tracker.” In the “issue_tracker” this will automatically go to the “needs_triage” section. During the Monday Workgroup Leads meeting and Thursday Support Workgroups meeting, issues that are in that “needs_triage” column will be scoped and prioritized. - Assignee - Assign all relevant team members that need to work on the issue or need to provide input. - Labels- Review labels list and select all potential MTL dependencies and indicators of responsible workgroup. - Milestones - Select the dependent Monthly Milestone. The team member working on the issue will later edit the bottom half of the issue to scope and cost the work. Cards using this template will go through either the issue_tracker (https://mtl.how/issues) or the feature_tracker (https://mtl.how/features) which have respective columns for ranking and prioritizing items and progressing them along the tracker as they get finished. Documents This template is used in the document_tracker to track the steps needed to update documents across each of the 12 sessions of Modeling to Learn in the 5 columns of the document_tracker. If this template needs to be used, “create a new issue” here, delete the template contents in the issue and copy + paste the documents template instead. Make sure to check off items as they get completed. No box should be left unchecked when the card is closed. Cards using this template will go be placed in one of the 5 columns of the document tracker (https://mtl.how/documents). Document cards do not flow through the tracker. Rather they stay in their respective columns of the tracker at all times. They are opened or closed as changes made in the issue_tracker and feature_tracker create documentation dependencies. Manuscripts This template is used when a new card needs to be created for a new manuscript associated with a project in OSF. The naming convention for the card is “abbreviated-grant-name_abbreviated-paper-name_abbreviated-journal-name”. For example, “r21_mm_gmb” would mean the paper is related to the R21 grant (r21), focused on the Medication Management module (mm), and will be submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (jama). Once the OSF project is created for this manuscript, the link to the project is added to the end as well. If this template needs to be used, go to “Step 1” to create a new issue, delete the template contents in the issue and copy + paste the manuscript template instead. You will notice that the sections of the issue match the columns of the manuscript_tracker. The card should not advance to the next column unless all of the boxes for that column are checked off. Cards using this template will go through the manuscript_tracker (mtl.how/manuscripts) as the manuscript progresses to getting done. "],

["how-to-create-your-own-branch.html", "7.4 How to Create Your Own Branch", " 7.4 How to Create Your Own Branch For instructions on creating and deleting branches, click here. Note: Never delete branches that are not your own. Why do we create branches? It is important to always create branches to edit or create new files when working in the GitHub repository to prevent version control issues. For example, if two people are working on the same file at the same time in the branch, then one or both parties could lose their edits. 7.4.1 Pull Request Tutorial Understanding pull requests, aka: why it’s important to sync your own branch with the master branch before you do any work on your own branch, aka: how to move from a self-oriented view (everyone needs to incorporate my work) to a team-oriented view (we all need to incorporate each others work in our own work - in real time). In this example, even though I only made the ‘lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot’ branch yesterday afternoon… …the branch I created named ‘lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot’ was 139 commits and 74 file changes behind the Team PSD Master branch this morning. 7.4.2 Open a New Pull Request - Before Working When I open a pull request and I see the master branch on the LEFT, what I am checking is whether I have made any changes on my own branch that aren’t yet reflected in the master. In other words, if I don’t open the pull request to sync any of my recently completed work with the master, the others on the team won’t have my most recent work reflected in their branches. See image 1 below, which shows the master on the left (master &lt;- lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot) When I open a pull request and I see the master branch on the RIGHT, what I am checking is whether other TeamPSD members have made any changes on the master that aren’t yet reflected in my own branch. In other words, if I don’t open the pull request to sync with the master, I would working on outdated copies of files &amp; file structures on my own branch. See images 2 and 3 below, which shows the master on the right (lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot &lt;- master) Image 1 shows my own branch has nothing new to offer the master branch (i.e., I haven’t done any new work on my own branch that isn’t already reflected in the TeamPSD master branch). So, I don’t have any changes on my branch to pull into the master. But, if I click the blue link (shown above in image 1) to try switching the base, I see that my own branch that I created yesterday is way behind the master branch. Across the team, 139 commits have been made to the master branch since I created my working copy of the master at lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot. So, before I start working I want to pull these changes fro the team in to my own branch so I’m working on the most current copy. Or, if I select to view the file tab instead of the commits tab, I am 74 file changes behind the master branch on my own branch, which I can review line by line (green highlight means added edits, red highlight means removed edits). That means, I really need to pull these changes from the master branch into my own branch before I start working to incorporate everyone’s edits, changes, formatting, and avoid rework across the team! Note that in images 2 and 3 if I click the green Create Pull Request button it begins the opportunity to discuss and compare the changes across the team. At the end of my working session on my own branch, when I create the pull request there are likely going be differences in both directions: my own branch to master (master &lt;- lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot) and master to my own branch (lz_mtl_facilitate_pilot &lt;- master). Most likely, I have been working, and others on the team have been working. If we were working on the same files, then creating the pull request begins the team process of *discussing and comparing the changes across the team. So, be sure to leave some time for the pull request process, in case you need to review and discuss conflicts between your pull requests and others before you wrap-up your work session.** Once you select the green “Create pull request” button at the top, make sure to add: Reviewers - Select team members whose review or feedback you need on this code. Assignee - Select team members that will be responsible for merging the pull request into the master branch. This will likely be an HQ member. Labels- Review labels list and select all potential MTL dependencies and indicators of responsible workgroup. Projects - DO NOT add pull requests to any projects. Milestones - Select the dependent Monthly Milestone. Note: DO NOT edit in the branch you used to create the pull request once the pull request has been created. Once you create a pull request, this means you are handing your work off for review. If another team member is reviewing your work while you are simultaneously continuing to edit that branch, their review will become moot as the content changes underneath them. Hint 1 - The surest way to make sure you are current with master is to start your own fresh branch before you work. If you do so, there should be no edits in either direction in the beginning, but there are still likely to be differences on that new branch from the master when you wrap-up your work. So…it’s cleaner and way easier to track if you have only one working copy (branch) you are using, especially if there are outstanding pull requests from one of your branches that is being reviewed by the team. Hint 2 - We want only active branches on the TeamPSD repository. So you should clean up old stale branches that you aren’t using. Summary: We all need to begin and end all of our working sessions on our own branches by using pull requests. Pull requests are the way to stay consistently current 💯with everyone’s work, as reflected by the master branch. This helps us review, edit, format and collaborate in real-time with parallel workflows to avoid rework. 7.4.3 mtl.how/teampsd vs. mtl.how Pull Request workflow TeamPSD repository is for our “works in progress” while the mtl.how repository has the “best versions” of our materials. The two repositories cannot automatically “update” each other. Meaning, if anything is changed in one repository, it has to manually be updated in the other repository. Once a file has been fully updated via pull requests in mtl.how/teampsd, HQ or an official point person will move the file over to the corresponding place in mtl.how. To Copy &amp; Paste code, click on the “Raw” button in the top right. After, create a regular pull request as outlined above to merge the changes. To access previous versions of a file: 1. Click on the “History” button at the top right. This will show you a list of commits made to the file in that repository and you can trace it back to the version of your choice. Or, you can delete your branch and start a new branch from the most recent version on the master branch. Click on “Branches” from the main repository page Look for the branch you want to delete and click on the trashcan icon next to it to delete. "],

Make sure to follow the TeamPSD convention (all lowercase, no spaces). Then, hit Ok. - A message will pop up in the top right with a red circle to indicate that you are recording. When the meeting is done, click on this red circle, and then Stop Recording. 4. End Meeting - After the meeting is done, take any messages from the “Chat” and copy+paste into the Lucid Chat section. Then, click on the upper right drop down on the pod, and “Clear Chat.” We want to keep a record of the chat as folks often send important feedback through there. - End the meeting by clicking on “Meeting,” then “End Meeting.” This will boot everyone out of the current Adobe Connect session. It is important to do End Meeting instead of Exit Adobe Connect, as the meeting room will continue to run and charge resources if we do not end. 5. Backup Recording in TeamPSD folder - Click on “Meeting,” then “Manage Meeting” Information. - This will prompt you to login again. Again, click on “Registered User” and login with the TeamPSD account. This will take you to the Adobe Connect admin dashboard. - Click on “Recordings” at the top. This will show you a list of all the Adobe Connect recordings from our team. Find the one you just created, then click on the drop down next to “Actions” and select “Make Offline.” - This will prompt a save dialgoue window to pop-up. Save it to the appropriate TeamPSD folder based on your workgroup’s workflow. - Note: The backup will need to run for at a minimum the recording’s run-time (if not more) to properly backup. If anyone uses the mtl.how/live meeting room in that time, the backup will have issues. As such, plan when you will start the backup around other workgroups and meetings, who will likely use the platform. 9.4.0.1 Common Mistakes: Make sure to turn on your microphone or else you will get visuals but no audio in the recording. Alert folks to turn off their computer speakers when you are turning your microphone on as this will cause audio feedback. Double check the recording backup once it’s done to ensure sound and visuals were properly backed up. "],

Ep1 Veterans Affairs Project Home Page There are really only three MTL projects, each organized into a DEV, TEST and PROD instance. These instances have specific uses and although you may have access to all, you may not interact with all of them. DEV – This instance is for the exclusive use of the Development Team (A.K.A. “DEV”). DEV develops each sprint in this instance until they are satisfied it is ready for user testing. When satisfied, they will promote a sprint to TEST. TEST – This instance is for the Workgroup Leads and others to conduct user testing of the sprint. When the testing and resulting development iterations are completed, the sprint is released to PROD. PROD – This is the Production instance that is available to the MTL Community for use. Left-hand Navigation – The left-hand navigation contains Team Home, Members, End Users and Settings selections. We are mainly concerned with Members and End Users selections, which we discuss later on in training. Ep2 Navigate to Members. Click “Members” on the left-hand menu. Members are people within the project organization, who are either authors or customer support. Authors can create and delete projects, add members, change member roles and have full administrative privileges. Customer support members can perform most administrative tasks, short of project maintenance (adding, deleting, etc.). Members are usually added or deleted at the direction of the Principal Investigator (PI) or by members of Praxis Analytix. Ep3 Navigate to End Users Click “End Users” on the left-hand menu. All individuals who are registered to use a given group-world as a student, admin or other must have an End User account. These accounts are identified by the person’s name and the email with which the registered. Changes to user accounts, such as name or passwords, can be made here by admins. Ep4 Navigate to a Project Instance. Click VA Sim UI – TEST instance. The VA Sim UI – Test page will appear. Notice these elements on the page. Ep5 Navigate to the Model Directory. The Model directory contains all Vensim model and Team Data files. Delete a file – To delete a file, click the checkbox and a delete button will appear. Click the delete button. Ep6 Upload a file – Click the “Upload” button and select “Upload a File” from the drop down to upload a file. Ep7 **Navigate to the Interface Directory.” The Interface directory contains information that can be changed by the user. We are mainly concerned with the DynamicData folder, as it contains user customizable files. Click Dynamic Data – Inside this folder is the model-popup-information.xlsx file. This file contains the Sim UI “i” information text that is used in the pop ups. When this file is updated, it must be first deleted – then replaced by an updated file. Ep8 Manipulate a File – If you want to view the contents of the model-popup-information.xlsx file, you must click it. Then select “View Raw.” The file will download, and you can review it using Microsoft Excel. Ep9 Ep10 Navigate to Groups Directory Epicenter has a two-tiered hierarchy for organizing users; namely, “Groups” and “Worlds.” However, for simplicity, the VA project has consolidated groups and worlds into a single tier.

Gm1a Navigate to the Groups directory. The Groups directory contains a listing of all groups that can currently login to this instance of the Sim UI. Groups follow a naming convention as is described below. See Gm1 for an illustration of the web page. Team naming convention for Epicenter groups is broken down into 4 parts below. Note that you can ask the Team Lead for this information: 1. 3-digit numeric health care system + 2 digit alphanumeric location (i.e. 640a0) 2. 3-digit alpha location code (i.e. mpd) 3. local team name (i.e. pct) 4. “team” for team world and “ind” for individual world Put together, it looks like: 640a0_mpd_pct_team Gm1 Edit a Group Although the Edit a Group page appears to allow editing of group information, it does not. Only the group’s Start, and Expiration dates are truly editable, with one exception. If the group has expired, then changing the expiration date will not work. Gm2 Add a Group Ignore Organization Name and Event name. Enter the Group name using the convention in number 1 above directly into the Group Name field. The start date will automatically show today’s date. Set the expiration date to “never.” Ignore Maximum End Users and Run Limit. Click “Create Group.” Gm3 Add End Users End Users can be loaded individually, provided they are already an End User (remember checking the End Users list on the Project Home Page?). End Users can also be loaded in bulk. When loaded in bulk, Epicenter will check to see if they are an End User, and if not, will assign them an End User account using the name, username and password contained in the master_end_user_template.xlsx. The Bulk-Add End Users will be the most common way to set up a team. While inside an empty Group and having compiled a roster using the template: a. Click on “Add End Users” b. Click on “Upload Users” by the Upload Multiple End Users title. c. Find the related file. Click “Open.” d. If there are End Users in the Bulk Add file already listed as End Users elsewhere, you will be given an option to overwrite the existing End User file (See gm5). You should “Keep and Add to Group” to prevent overwriting the existing End User File. gm4 Gm5a Gm5b Multiplayer Assignments When new End Users are first assigned to a Group, they only are listed in the End User Details tab. To use the Sim UI, they must be assigned to World001. Keep in mind there can be many worlds, but all users must be assigned to World001. Typically, one user is considered the Team Lead, and the rest are players. However, there is no limit on the number of Team Leads there can be. Team Leads are presented with a different Home Page when logging into the Sim UI. Click on the “Multiplayer Assignments” tab. Review list to ensure all added to the group appear on the list. Identify the team leaders and mouse-over the “Edit” function. The World and Role drop down menus should appear. If the first time, only World001 will be a choice. Change role to “Team Lead.” Click on “Save” to preserve settings. Repeat for each player. Gm6 Making End Users Inactive An End User assigned to a World can be made inactive by checking the box and clicking the “X” next to Unassign. When unassigned, the users will stay on the list, but will not have a world assignment. Without assignment to World001, they will not be able to login to a Sim UI session with this Group. Gm7 Making End Users Inactive Making End Users Inactive removes them from the Multiplayer Assignments list and to the Inactive Users list. This done by checking the checkbox next to the user’s name and then selecting the red “X” next to “Make Inactive.” This action is not recommended, because it changes to the calculations of the team statistics in the Facilitator panel. Unassigning users is the preferred way. Assigning a Facilitator Facilitators are assigned in the End User Details tab. Select the “Edit” icon under the Actions column. Select the “Yes” radio button to make the selected user a Facilitator. Note that a Facilitator cannot be assigned to any World. Be sure to make inactive before making a Facilitator.

GIVEN: 1. A photo at this link https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_facilitate/graphics/wiley_e_coyote.png A biography (copy from below) Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as “the Coyote”) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. In each episode, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which backfire comically, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme. SUBTASKS: 1. Upload a graphics file to the appropriate location in Epicenter. 2.

["full-instructions-11.html", "19.3 Full Instructions", " 19.3 Full Instructions TeamPSD uses Markdown, a markup language for simple formatting, across multiple workgroups and workflows including GitHub and OSF. We add the “.md” file extension to our file names in GitHub to change “Raw Code” into a formatted file using Markdown language. Pro Tip: When using Markdown in GitHub in “Edit” mode, you can switch between the “Code View” and the “Formatted View” by clicking on “Preview Changes” at the top left. You can also see the “Code View” on a saved file, by clicking on “Raw” in the top right corner to see the “Code View” of the file. Below are the markdown options you will most often use: 19.3.1 1. YAML Header A YAML header is used only at the top of every document, meaning for example, we DO NOT use this on issue cards but we DO use this on Learner SEE guides. - The text coming after each section of the YAML header must be contained within quotes (“text”) to format properly. - In the author section, we will always put “TeamPSD”. Oftentimes our work is a collection of the efforts and ideas of multiple team members past and present. - In the date section, DO NOT erase the previous person’s record of name and date the file was worked on. Instead, add your name and date in while still keeping the record of previous contributors to the document in the YAML header. - The output section outlines all of the possible ways the document can be outputted in R. For more instructions on that, click here. 19.3.1.1 Code View: --- title: &quot;Write a descriptive title here&quot; author: &quot;Team PSD&quot; date: &quot;add your name/initials and the date&quot; output: github_document: default html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default ioslides_presentation: default slidy_presentation: default powerpoint_presentation: default --- 19.3.1.2 Formatted View: Look to the very top of this document. 19.3.2 2. Carriage Return In Markdown, if you use the “Enter” key alone, you will not get a carriage return (unlike MS Word for example). To create the “carriage return,” you need to use two spaces after your text followed by the “Enter” key. 19.3.2.1 Code View Sentence 1. Followed by no carriage return. Sentence 10. Followed by a carriage return. 19.3.2.2 Formatted View Sentence 1. Followed by no carriage return. Sentence 10. Followed by a carriage return. 19.3.3 3. Bold To bold a piece of text, use double asterisks (**) before and after the text with no spaces between the text and symbols. 19.3.3.1 Code View: **This is how you bold text.** 19.3.3.2 Formatted View: This is how you bold text. 19.3.4 4. Italicize To italicize a piece of text, use single asterisks (*) or an underscore (_) before and after the text with no spaces between the text and symbols. 19.3.4.1 Code View: *You can italicize text like this.* _Or you can italicize like this._ 19.3.4.2 Formatted View: You can italicize text like this. Or you can italicize like this. 19.3.5 5. Headers Headers are created by using hashtags (#) with an increasing number of hashtags used to create smaller and smaller headers. Before the relevant piece of text, add hashtag(s) followed by a space before the text. 19.3.5.1 Code View: # This is a Level 1 Header. ## This is a Level 2 Header. ### This is a Level 3 Header. #### This is a Level 4 Header. 19.3.5.2 Formatted View: "],

Numbered Lists To create numbered lists, use numbers and a period followed by a space before the text, with a carriage return per numbered item. To create multiple levels, in the list add 3 spaces before the number for each new level. 20.1.2.1 Code View: 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 1. Item 3a 2. Item 3b 1. Item 3b-1 2.

Links &amp; Images To hyperlink a piece of text, put the linked text in brackets () and the link in parentheses ( () ). To add images, you can either use Markdown formatting () or the HTML image tag (). The benefit of the HTML image tag is the ability to specify the height and width of the image. You can find the link to the image needed for the code by navigating to the image on your browser, then copy + paste the link at the top of the webpage. Finally, to create a hyperlinked image, combine the code for hyperlinking text and the HTML image tag(). 20.1.4.1 Code View: Hyperlink text [insert text here](insert link here - i.e. https://github.com) Add image Markdown format - ![](include the link to the image here - i.e. https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/logos/modeling_to_learn_sm.png?raw=true) HTML image tag - &lt;img src=&quot;include the link to the image here i.e. https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/logos/modeling_to_learn_sm.png?raw=true&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt; Hyperlink image [insert HTML image tag here - i.e. &lt;img src = &quot;https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/logos/mtl_live_sq_sm.png&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; width=&quot;290&quot;&gt;](https://github.com/lzim/mtl/blob/master/session03/s03_learner/mtl_session03_see.md) 20.1.4.2 Formatted View: Hyperlink text insert text here Add image Markdown format - HTML image tag - Hyperlink image 20.1.5 9. Task Lists You can create task lists with boxes that you can “check off”. To “check off” the boxes, either manually put an “x” between the brackets or click on the square box that the code produces in the formatted version. 20.1.5.1 Code View: - [x] Task 1 - [x] Task 2 - [x] This is a complete item - [ ] This is an incomplete item 20.1.5.2 Formatted View: Task 1 Task 2 This is a complete item This is an incomplete item 20.1.6 10. Tables You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (between the top header row and the rest of the table), and then separating each column with a pipe |. Make sure that there are the same number of columns created in each row as the maximum number of columns needed. For example, if you use 3 pipes to create 4 columns toward the middle of your table, every row in the table needs 3 pipes (regardless of whether each cell has text or not) for the table to properly format. 20.1.6.1 Code View: First Header | Second Header ------------ | ------------- Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 Content in the first column | Content in the second column 20.1.6.2 Formatted View: First Header Second Header Content from cell 1 Content from cell 2 Content in the first column Content in the second column 20.1.7 11. Username @mentions You can ping someone in any issue or pull request in the comments thread. We use this when we are discussing an item back and forth across several team members or if you need to alert them to a specific issue. You can ping someone by using the @ symbol followed by someone’s GitHub username (with no spaces). Be careful that you are pinging the correct person. Many people have similar names across GitHub and you can inadvertently ping the wrong person in the world with the same name, if you are not using the exact username for the intended person. 20.1.7.1 Code View: @staceypark 20.1.7.2 Formatted View: @staceypark 20.1.8 12. Cross-referencing Issues You can cross-reference issues in any issue or pull requests in the comments thread. We use this function to ensure that issues that are related to each other in terms of dependency or may have related conversations that are split are “cross-referenced” to each other. To “cross-reference” an issue, use a single hashtag (#) followed by the issue number (with no spaces). 20.1.8.1 Code View: #605 20.1.8.2 Formatted View: #605 20.1.8.3 Common Mistakes: Double check that you’ve used the correct number of spaces for the type of formatting you want to do. If links are involved in the code, double check the link and make sure it still works. Double check that you are using two spaces between sentences to create a carriage return. "],

Copy the last tt_report_## folder. Update the report number to the next number in the sequence for both the folder and the word doc inside it. Open the word doc. ### Within the Word Doc, in order from top to bottom: - Update the report number under the team time logo. - Place weekly announcements at the top of the report within the first box of text, including any updates relevant across the team with screenshots and links if necessary. Make sure that MTL or Modeling to Learn is in italics, consistent with TeamPSD style, throughout the report. - For mtl.how/zenhub replace the existing Epic information (e.g. “april” priority is underway and ends 4/24) with current information. - For screenshots, replace the existing ones with new ones for the Control Chart and Burndown Report. - For the Control Chart - Go to mtl.how/zenhub - Hover over the left-hand menu. - Click on Reports &gt; Control Charts. - At the top, select “Custom Range” for dates and set the dates to align with the current epic by using the “Start” and “End” dates found on the Roadmap. - For the “Start Pipeline,” select “Priority Epic” and for the “Completed Pipeline,” select “Closed.” - Make sure all repos are selected (Repos 2/2) for the data. - Screenshot only the stats numbers and not the control chart itself. - For the Burndown Report - Go to mtl.how/zenhub - Hover over the left-hand menu. - Click on Reports &gt; Burndown Report. - At the top, select the current milestone. - For the date range, set the “Start” and “Due by” dates to align with the current epic by using the “Start” and “End date found on the Roadmap. - On the upper right hand side, double check that”Closed\" (default) is selected for the “Burn Pipeline”. - Screenshot the chart, including the story points and issues counts underneath it. - Hyperlink both screenshots to mtl.how/zenhub. To hyperlink: - Right-click on relevant text. - Click on “Link”. - Paste the link into “Address”. - Click on “Ok”. - For mtl.how/lucid, take a screenshot of the next two weeks from Lindsey’s team Lucid calendar. Make sure to ping all Workgroup Leads regarding updates and changes prior to taking this screenshot. Replace the existing screenshot with the new one. Ensure that any discrepancies or duplicate meetings are addressed by workgroup leads and reflected in the calendar. - For mtl.how/bugs, mtl.how/features, mtl.how/manuscripts, and mtl.how/documents, go to each of these shortlinks and screenshot the trackers. Replace the existing screenshots with the new ones. - Make sure the text for each of the short links is hyperlinked to the matching link. - All the screenshots should show the first 5 columns of each tracker (except the Bug tracker, which should show all 6 columns). To increase visibility take screenshots in full-screen mode. Screenshots for each of the trackers should specifically show these columns: - Bug tracker - needs_triage to closed. - Features tracker - work_breakdown to functional_testing. - Manuscript tracker - 01_osf_project to 05_approval_letter. - Documents tracker - describe_learners to depend_products. - Make sure the screenshots for each of the trackers are hyperlinked to their matching trackers as well. - Screenshots should be large enough that the text is readable and meaningful. 21.2.2 Copy to Outlook: Ctrl + A to select everything in the document Ctrl + C to copy Open a new Outlook email and in the body, Ctrl + V to paste your tt report Double check: All fonts are in Myriad Pro (or the most similar sans-serif font) All colors are consistent with TeamPSD style which can be found here. We use VA Light Blue for linked text, icons, and the announcements text box. We use VA Light Red for the arrows that separate each section. All items are aligned and not covering each other, or off the page.

REDCap or Research Electronic Data Capture, is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. REDCap was originally created by a small team at Vanderbilt, and has since expanded across thousands of non-profit and government organizations. Each system is independently maintained and supported - we specifically are using the VA REDCap. You can check out FAQ’s, videos, etc. at the main REDCap website here. When does TeamPSD use REDCAP? We use it in the Modeling to Learn program at Session 4 for the Modeling to Learn Menu (mtl.how/menu) that assesses team needs and priorities to pick an MTL module to use starting Session 5 Research surveys from measures in the grants that are taken at baseline and 6 months. Remember, these surveys are voluntary and can be stopped at any time. 22.4.1.1 Learning Check: What are TeamPSD’s varying uses of REDCap? How do they align against timelines with the Modeling to Learn 12 session plan? What audience is each use geared towards? 22.4.2 Login Go to the VA RedCAP link: https://vhacdwweb05.vha.med.va.gov/index.php?action=myprojects Note: This is a VA webiste and is only available within the VA firewall. Username will be your VA username/alias available in the GAL in Outlook. If you don’t have an account, or need to create a new account for other folks, go here. Enter YOUR VA email address. Check the box “Creating new VA REDCap accounts.” Download the .csv that is attached and fill it out with the names, VA emails, and VA usernames for accounts you are requesting and upload it back to the form. Hit “Submit.” 22.4.3 Overview of REDCap This overview video of REDCap video includes how to create new projects in REDCap and how to edit records. 22.4.3.1 Learning Check: Our team will not typically fill in survey records for our participants. Based on what we learned about our TeamPSD’s survey uses, why might this be the case? While we typically wouldn’t enter/edit records, in what situation might an HQ member enter data in a record instead of the learner? A learner has a question about their survey data, where do you go to check or edit their record? Can you create more than one instrument in the same project? If so, how? How do you add new users to a project? (More detailed distinctions between the user rights and roles is covered further down in the this training). Where do you go to view records? What types of data views can you access here? How do you export data? (Note: DO NOT put your fake project in production.) Once you put your project in production, how do you make changes? 22.4.4 How to Create and Work with Instruments This introduction to instrument development and online instrument designer view details how to use “instruments” in REDCap. 22.4.4.1 Learning Check: Where do you click to build new instruments? Where do you click to view existing instruments? How do you move, add, and edit instrument fields in the online designer (what buttons do you click or clicking do you do)? Where do you go to view the status of each record? What do each of the colors mean on this dashboard? What is another way you can update instruments fields? Where do you go to view the mode of the project (development, production, etc.)? (Go to second video) How do you enable/disable, rename, or delete surveys? What are the five buttons on each field instrument and what are their functions? STOP at timestamp 5:00 minutes on the second video. Within a survey instrument, click on “Survey Settings.” What customization options do you see here and where can we apply our TeamPSD style here? 22.4.5 Managing Design, Automation, and Participant Management Follow this PDF through for a walkthrough of different customization options for designing and queuing instruments, managing invitations and participants. 22.4.5.1 Learning Check: SKIP the “Design Options, Notifications, Automated Invitations” section. How will we use the survey queuing function with our Modeling to Learn teams and why is it important? What can happen if we get this logic incorrect? On the “Public Survey Link” page, where can you find the link to the survey? Since we use co-branded links, what is the next step to ensure that the co-branded link goes to the correct page? Why might we want to use the login or access code function? 22.4.6 User Rights &amp; Roles Review this PDF that outlines the rights and abilities for different types of access by role to help make decisions on what roles team members should be assigned. 22.4.6.1 Learning Check: What are the groups of team members that will need access to VA REDCap? How will they interact with the platform and what user roles will be most appropriate? 22.4.6.2 OVERALL Learning Check: Define each of the words below and what vocabulary they map to in our Modeling to Learn or TeamPSD language (i.e. Users in REDCap = HQ or Team Members in TeamPSD): Users Projects Instruments Participants Queue Records 22.4.6.3 Common Mistakes: If you’re clicking through any of the surveys to test them, make sure to delete your records afterwards so it does not affect our data reports and analysis. Are you or someone unable to see specific menu options that they typically expect to see? Check the user roles. "]
