Click the Empty to begin adding content to the columns. *Note: Uploading portraits is tricky, as there isn’t a utility to size, crop or center the photo.

Otherwise, the web page will not be able to find the file in the Dynamic Data folder.*

## Quick Checklist:

_There is no checklist provided for this module._

#### Common Mistakes:

1. The most common error on this page is to forget to click the Check button after entering text. This is very discouraging, especially with a longer paragraph.  It is recommended to edit the text in MS-Notepad or related word processor prior to uploading into text fields.
2. There are many errors associated with graphics files:  
   - The graphics file has the wrong extension in the name. *For example, the name says samplefile.jpg, when it is really samplefile.png.*  
   - The Admin did not upload the graphics file into the correct directory on Epicenter.  
   - The photo file not the target resolution or of adequate aspect ratio to properly fit into the photo frame.

## Training Record: 

### Practice  

- [ ] **Exercise:** You have been tasked to welcome a new member of the team to the Sim UI workgroup section in the Team PSD website (TEST instance).

**GIVEN:**
1. A photo at this link https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_facilitate/graphics/wiley_e_coyote.png

2. A biography (copy from below)

Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as "the Coyote") and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. In each episode, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which backfire comically, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme.

**SUBTASKS:**
1. Upload a graphics file to the appropriate location in Epicenter.
2. Create a new member in the Sim UI section of the Team PSD website (Test instance).
3. Properly link the graphics file to the new section.
4. Add the text in the text field and,
