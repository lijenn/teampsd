The MTL Demo – Slider section allows you to add, delete or edit the name of a slider graphics file. *Note: The .gif is the standard motion file for Team PSD, because it is the only motion file accepted by GitHub. Furthermore, due to file size limitations in GitHub, the .gif can only be about 14 seconds long with a standard resolution screen cast.*

5. **Resource Management Section**
The Resource Management Section contains all of the Demo site’s dynamic web contents, such as files, slides and graphics. Resources in the top 4 lines of the table are fixed resources and cannot be deleted or added onto. However, the text and associated links are editable.  
   a.  How to add a link and link title to text.  
      1. When the code reads the phrase “##Link1##” it will look for the first link in the Link column.  
      2. It will use the first title associated in the Title column to display in the body of the text.  
      3. When the user looks on the screen, they will see a blue text consistent with the title and execute the associated link.  
      4. All text sections can accommodate up to 6 links and associated titles.

## Quick Checklist:

_There is no checklist provided for this module._

#### Common Mistakes:

1. The most common error on this page is to forget to click the Check button after entering text.  This is very discouraging, especially with longer paragraph.  Recommend editing text in MS-Notepad or related word processor prior to uploading into text fields.

2. There are many errors associated with graphics files:

   - The graphics file has the wrong extension in the name.  For example, the name says samplefile.jpg, when it is really samplefile.png. 
   - The Admin did not upload the graphics file into the correct directory on Epicenter.
3. Admins will attempt to add more days to a demo account after the account has expired.
4. Admins will forget to update the course code in the course_code.xlsx spreadsheet.
5. Admins will incorrectly enter the course code in the course_code.xlsx spreadsheet. 
6. When a Demo user account expires, they must be removed as an End User from Epicenter before they can re-register.
