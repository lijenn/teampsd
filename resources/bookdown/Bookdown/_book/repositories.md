## External links needed:
1. mtl.how
2. mtl.how/teampsd

## Training Objectives:
Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to:

1. Understand the difference between the purpose of the two GitHub repositories that TeamPSD uses
2. Identify what workflows are associated with each repository

## Full Instructions
### 1. mtl.how
The mtl.how repository is our home page for the *Modeling to Learn* 12 Session Program. 
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a home base for learners to access the links and resources they need to go through the *MTL* 12 Session Program.  
While changes can be made through pull requests on this repository, they should occur on a "Release" schedule that is coordinated across workgroups and site intervention. 
However, if there are any errors in any of the resources (i.e. spelling typo), this should be changed immediately with a pull request, outside of the "Release" schedule.

This repository is organized by the two arms of our grants:
1. Modeling to Learn RED 
2. Modeling to Learn BLUE

This repository includes:
- Learner SEE guides
- Facilitator SAY guides
- Model files
- Cheatsheets
- Shortlinks to *MTL* sites
- Community of Practice / Wiki

### 2. mtl.how/teampsd
The mtl.how/teampsd repository is our "Works-In-Progress" repository. 
The purpose of this repository is to iterate on documents, discuss ideas, and serve as our file and workflow management system as we work to produce the best version of each product.

This repository is organized (largely) by the different TeamPSD workgroups: 
1. .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE - Includes the template for creating issues. **Do not touch unless decisions were made to update this in a Workgroup Leads meeting**.
2. ees_workgroup
3. issue_templates - Includes templates for creating other types of issues/cards that do not follow the main Issue Template (i.e. manuscript_tracker).
4. model_workgroup	
5. mtl_facilitate_workgroup	
6. pubs_workgroup	
7. qual_workgroup	
8. quant_workgroup	
9. resources - Includes a broad range of TeamPSD resources, including training_guides, headshots, r help, etc.
10. sim_ui_workgroup	
11. vapor

This repository includes:
- All of our work that can be public-facing including the files at mtl.how and more
- Trackers Workflow (mtl.how/issues; mtl.how/features; mtl/how/documents; mtl.how/manuscripts)


**Note: Both of our repositories are public and anyone can see any part of our workflow at any time.**
