7. Afterwards, before you hit "Commit" Make sure you are not commiting directly to the master branch. **NEVER commit directly to the master branch**.
If you have already created your own branch, commit it there, or follow the dialogue below to create a new branch, using the changes you just made and hit "Propose new file".
