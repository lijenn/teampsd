# MS Teams
TeamPSD and the VA are both using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) as their main communication platform.

TeamPSD is currently using the **Free Version of Microsoft Teams** so the entire team can get used to it as the VA begins to roll it out system-wide between mid-July to early August.
