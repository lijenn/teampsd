# MS Teams
TeamPSD and the VA are both using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) as their main communication platform.

TeamPSD is currently using the **Free Version of Microsoft Teams** so the entire team can get used to it as the VA begins to roll it out system-wide between mid-July to early August.  

## Quick Start Guide
To review the basics of Microsoft Teams, check out their [Quick Start Guide](https://www.chorus.co/media/2989/quickstart-guide-to-teams-chorus.pdf).

3. You will notice a subtle red border outlining your entire desktop screen. 
The red border is only visible to you and not anyone else, hence not pictured here.

TIP: Queue up the window you want to share in advance.
I had already quequed up my Google Chrome Browser in the background, which is now being shared as the default of entire desktop screen.

4. Drag in other window/browsers within the red border to show dual screens.

Here I am showing Google Chrome and Teams:

### Disappeared Meeting

To find a meeting call's screen once you've clicked out of the meeting to look elsewhere on Temas (i.e you needed to respond to a ping, when to look for a link in a discussion thread, etc.):

1. Minimize the Teams browser completely by clicking on the middle (-) button at the top header of the browser:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89908115-5d04c500-dba2-11ea-9760-4f4ccb648232.png)

2. Go to a new browser or your desktop and the meeting call should appear in the bottom right hand corner:

Alternative (only applicable to Channel Meetings, not Private 1:1 meetings):

If you remember which Channel the meeting call was in, you can click back into the meeting by 'Joining' in again, this will not show you joining twice as you are just re-joining.
